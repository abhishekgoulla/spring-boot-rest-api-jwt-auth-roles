# Toll Roads Blockchain Management System 

## 1. PROBLEMS

Toll roads payment infrastructure (from booths to the Regulator) face a series of logistical problems, which can be successfully addressed by Blockchain.

### 1.1. Safety
Among many concerns involving safety in Toll Roads and their contexts, two very serious are:

#### 1.1.1. Robbery
When the tolls are collected in cash by the booths, a great amount of money hangs in there to be stolen. In Brazil, for instance, it is not a rare fact to have toll booths robbed in the late night. The armored cars that take the money from the booths to the bank are also at risk of being robbed. Putting the funds in the Blockchain entirely solves this problem.

#### 1.1.2. Lack of Transparency (corruption)
Regulators are usually part of the public sector, maintained by taxpayers' money. When that is the case, the only data sources available regarding the number of vehicles that have gone through the toll booths are the Operators and the Regulators themselves, being that the later has to rely solely on the former for those data (a very centralized system). In this context, when money is detoured from the Regulator, it is public money that is being stolen. By using Blockchain, not only the number of paying vehicles but also the total amount collected by the Operator and due to the Regulator are transparently visible to anyone.

As mentioned, this lack of transparency comes from the centralization that arises from a single source of information, the Operator. By making the payment transactions publicly available, this information starts to be generated by the payers, collectively, causing the Operators to no longer stand as the single source of truth. 


### 1.2. Speed
Toll Roads systems also face issues related to speed in both, funds transfer and implementation of changes.

#### 1.2.1. Funds transfer
In the current state of affairs, the cash is collected by the booths which are periodically visited by armored cars which take the funds to the bank. After that, the Operator needs to remmit the Regulator's collected fees (when applicable). By using Blockchain, both, Operators and Regulators can receive the funds as soon as they are transferred to the booth. 

#### 1.2.2. Changing Rules
Rules, such as pricing, may change. When that happens, a logistical effort must be made to ensure that all booths are updated. Another thing that can change is the fee charged by the Regulator, which requires a lot of communication between the parties. If the rules, on the other hand, are implemented on the Blockchain, every change can take place seamlessly.

#### 1.2.3. Changing Road Operation Grants
A toll road may have its Operator changed. In these situations, a change in the employees' contracts or in the infrastructure of the booths may also take place. On the financial side, however, if the system is implemented on Blockchain, the only thing that needs to be changed is the owner of the Operator contract (the Blockchain one). After that, the funds can again be seamlessly sent from the booths to the correct Operator and Regulator without further changes.


### 1.3. Price
Another factor that might impact the toll value is the cost of transactions. Operators have high expenses with credit card operators and money transfers from bank to bank (e.g. to pay the Regulator), which can be substantially decreased by adopting a Blockchain as the money management platform.



## 2. PRICING

There are three questions regarding pricing: **the chargeable unit**, **the markup**, and **the annual increase**.

### 2.1. The Chargeable Unit
Different vehicles put different strains on the road. If we consider a road as a resource, a motorcycle consumes way less resources than a truck. An acceptable correlation between the strain and the vehicle is the number of wheels (or could also be axis, which is the number of wheels divided by two). That way, a regular four-wheels vehicle (two axis) will pay more than a motorcycle but less than a truck, and larger trucks will be charged more than smaller ones.

### 2.2. The Markup (profit margin)
In a free market society, prices - and profit margins - are regulated by supply/demand relation. However, in monopolistic services, such as a toll road (even in a consortium, a booth section in a given road does not usually face competition), external regulation must take place, in order to prevent abusive practices. 

To calculate an acceptable price, the Regulator must take into account: *the initial investment made by the operator* (booths construction, roads improvement, softwares, etc), *the operational costs* (salaries, infrastructure maintenance, transaction costs [in gas or not], etc), *return over investment (ROI) horizon*, and the *average number of wheels expected in a given time frame*. In addition, those costs are usually paid in local currency, thus, to convert them to Ether, an exchange rate calculation should be performed. An **Oracle** could be useful in this situation.

For the sake of the example, let's assume:

*Local currency* = USD

*USD/ETH* = $300,00 (**from Oracle**)

*Initial investment* = $250 million

*ROI horizon (ROIH)* = 5 years

*Markup* = 25%

*Monthly operational costs per toll station* = $1 million

*Average number of regular 4-wheel vehicles per toll station* = 1 million

Annualized estimated price in USD = ((Initial Investment / ROIH) + monthly costs x 12) / (Average number of vehicles x 12) x Markup

Annualized estimated price in USD = (($250 million / 5) + $1 million x 12) / (1 million x 12) * 1.25

*Annualized estimated price per regular vehicle in USD* = **$6.46**

*Annualized price **per wheel** in USD* = $6.46 / 4 = **$1.615**

*Annualized estimated price per wheel in ETH* = $1.615/$300 = **5383 szabo + gas**


### 2.3. Annual Increase
If the markup is good enough, the only price increase acceptable is the *inflation rate*. In this scenario, keeping the markup constant would encourage Operators to improve their processes in order to improve efficiency (possibly good to customers), thus, decreasing costs, thus, increasing their margins.



## 3. CONTRACTS
Five different types of contract can exist in this application. Their main responsibilities are described below.

### 3.1. The Regulator
. Deploys and controls Operators' contracts.

. Receives funds paid as fees from Operators.

. Transfers Operator's contracts ownership.

. Defines the pricing criteria: price per wheel, markup and annual increase.

. Provides an off-chain registration for Drivers and Vehicles that are going to use the Blockchain solution. It is necessary to keep track of and hold them accountable (e.g. toll evading or payment transaction not mined for any reason).

. Because the Regulator keeps track of the system users, it can be notified in case a payment was not processed, and further notify the payer. Also, if the Regulator belongs to the public sector, it can further enforce the payment by other means. 

. When the debt originated from a failed payment is finally quit, the Regulator notifies the proper Operator about it and grants credits accordingly (i.e. instead of receiving funds, the Operator can deduct the credits from the amount owed to the Regulator).

### 3.2. The Road Operator
. Deploys and controls Toll Booths contracts.

. Receives funds from Toll Booths.

. Transfers funds to Regulators according to the specified fee.

. Is notified about payments that were not processed, and notifies the Regulator which will notify the payer.

. Receives credits from Regulators when failed payments are quit.

### 3.3. The Toll Booth
. Receives fees from Drivers and Vehicles and forwards them to the Operator.

. Has a refund function for the narrow case where the Driver has issued a transaction but the network went down, and the Driver has paid with money.

. In case the transaction, for any reason, has failed, the debt is notified to the Operator which can notify the payer.

. There are several ways to perform the payment such as: 1) Bluetooth connection between the payer phone the the booth computer, 2) previous payment done by the payer and only confirmed by the booth, 3) list of payers registered with the Regulator and shown in the booth computer, which can generate a request on the payer's wallet. 

### 3.4. The Driver
. The Driver is not a contract but a regular Blockchain account.

. The Driver pays to the Toll Both based on the number of wheels of the car he is driving when going through the road.

### 3.5. The Vehicle 
. The Vehicle can be a contract for situations where it does not belong to the driver. For instance, if the vehicle belongs to a company and is used by multiple employees on duty, instead of having the employees to spend their own funds and then be reimbursed, the vehicle can have its own funds.


## 4. INTERACTIONS
Regarding the interactions of the contracts:

. The Regulator and its Operators are implemented according to the Hub/Spokes pattern, as well as the Operator and its Toll Booths and also the Regulators themselves, which are created by a Hub, since we can have Regulators in different jurisdictions.

. The toll paid by Drivers and Vehicles are immediately transferred to the Operator and Regulator accounts.

. Operators can kill Toll Booths as well as Regulators can kill Operators.

. Booths may work as Oracles, allowing users to know in advance how much is due at that booth.
